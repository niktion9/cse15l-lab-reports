# Lab Report 1
## Examples of the cd Command
> Example 1 (cd command with no arguments):

```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```

Working Directory: home directory (/home)
Explanation: The cd command stands for ":changing directory" meaning it take a directory as an argument and switched the cirectory to the one mentioned by the user. Since there was no argument following the cd command, the working directory is still the home directory, thus outputting a just a new empty command line.

Here is a codeblock, where I used the pwd (print working directory) command to check the working dorectory after the running the cd command with no arguments:

```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
```
