# Lab Report 1
## Examples of the cd Command
> Example 1 (cd command with no arguments):

```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```

Working Directory: home directory (/home)

Explanation: The cd command stands for "change directory", meaning it takes a directory as an argument and allows the user to move from the current directory to the one mentioned. Since there was no argument following the cd command, the working directory is still the home directory, thus outputting just a new empty command line.

Here is a codeblock, where I used the pwd (print working directory) command to check the working dorectory after the running the cd command with no arguments:

```
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
```
