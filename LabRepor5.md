# Lab Report 5

## Part 1:
### Student's post:
Hello TA, I am practing for Skill Demo 4 and I am stuck at step 3. I am trying to run the test file in the buggy directory with the ```test.sh``` command, and it is showing 2 errors as it should 
but I am not sure how to approach or understand the error messages and where to look for to fix, I am also not sure about what part of the code is inducing these failures. 
I would really appreciate some sort of a clue or guidance in solving this. Thank you!
