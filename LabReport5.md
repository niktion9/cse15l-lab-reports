### TA's response:
Hello, thank you for reaching out. When reading the error message, it can be seen that there 2 error. Let's solve them one by one.
Try looking underneath the first error error (which is "1) testMerge1(ListExamplesTests)") and notice how a line specifies "ListExamples.merge(ListExamples.java:33)"?
I suggest using ```vim``` to access the file content for editing and look into what needs to be fixed. Good luck!
