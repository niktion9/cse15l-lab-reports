Keys pressed: ```<Ctrl-K>```, ```<enter>``` 

I accidentally typed “.net” instead of ```.edu``` at the end of the ```$ ssh nmaderamitla@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu``` so I tried out ```<Ctrl-K>``` and I was quickly able to delete .net and replaced it correctly. Then I pressed enter so that the ssh command could be executed for the ```ieng6``` network to be connected and accessed by.

Keys pressed: ```<Ctrl-V>```, ```<enter>``` 

I used ```<Ctrl-V>``` to copy-paste the ssh git url. I then used the  ```<enter>```  key to execute git clone so the content in the forked repository can now be referred to and used.

Keys pressed: ```<enter>```

I used the ```cd``` command to change directory to lab7, pressed ```<enter>``` , and used the ```ls``` command to make sure ```test.sh``` file was part of the ```lab7``` directory in list it produced after using the ``` <enter> ``` key

Keys pressed: ```<enter>``` and ```<tab>```

I used the ```<tab>``` which filled in the letters for ```test.sh``` which saved some time. Then I used ```<enter>``` to excecute bash command to examine the ```test.sh``` file and return the failed test cases.

Keys pressed: ```<enter>``` and ```<tab>```

I used the ```<tab>``` which filled in the letters for ```ListExamples.java``` which saved a lot of time. Then I used ```<enter>``` to excecute the ```vim``` command in order to adress the error in code of the ```ListExamples.java``` file, and edit it in the terminal itself.
