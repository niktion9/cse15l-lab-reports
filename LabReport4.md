Working Directory: before and after running cd without parametrs: ```/home``` during the call of cd: ```/lecture1```

Keys pressed: ```<Ctrl-K>```, ```<enter>``` 

I accidentally typed “.net” instead of ```.edu``` at the end of the ```$ ssh nmaderamitla@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu``` so I tried out ```<Ctrl-K>``` and I was quickly able to delete .net and replaced it correctly. Then I pressed enter so that the ssh command could be executed for the ```ieng6``` network to be connected and accessed by.
