Keys pressed: I pressed ```ssh nmaderamitla@ieng6-202.ucsd.net```, then ```<Ctrl-K>```, then```ssh nmaderamitla@ieng6-202.ucsd.net```, and finally```<enter>``` 

I accidentally typed “.net” instead of ```.edu``` at the end of the ```$ ssh nmaderamitla@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu``` so I tried out ```<Ctrl-K>``` and I was quickly able to delete .net and replaced it correctly. Then I pressed enter so that the ssh command could be executed for the ```ieng6``` network to be connected and accessed by.

Keys pressed: I pressed ```git clone```, ```<Ctrl-V>``` (copy pasted the ssh git repo), ```<enter>``` 

I typed ```git clone``` to initate a git repo that needs to be cloned and used. I used ```<Ctrl-V>``` to copy-paste the ssh git url. I then used the  ```<enter>```  key to execute git clone so the content in the forked repository can now be referred to and used.

Keys pressed: ```cd lab7```, ```<enter>```, ```ls```, ```<enter>```

I used the ```cd``` command to change directory to lab7, pressed ```<enter>``` , and used the ```ls``` command to make sure ```test.sh``` file was part of the ```lab7``` directory in list it produced after using the ``` <enter> ``` key

Keys pressed: ```bash te``` and ```<tab>``` (to fill in ```test.sh``` after ```bash``` command), then ```<enter>```

I typed  ```bash``` to initiate the call of the bash file ```test.sh```. I used the ```<tab>``` which filled in the letters for ```test.sh``` which saved some time. Then I used ```<enter>``` to excecute bash command to examine the ```test.sh``` file and return the failed test cases.


## Step7
<img alt = "Screen Shot 2024-02-27 at 11.07.29 PM.png" src = "https://github.com/niktion9/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202024-02-27%20at%2011.07.29%20PM.png?raw=true">

Keys pressed: ```vim```, ```L <tab>.j<tab>```, ```<enter>```

I used the ```<tab>``` which filled in the letters for ```ListExamples.java``` which saved a lot of time. Then I used ```<enter>``` to excecute the ```vim``` command in order to adress the error in code of the ```ListExamples.java``` file, and edit it in the terminal itself.

Keys pressed: ```<down>```, ```<x>```, ```i```, ```2```, ```esc```, ```<:>, <w>, <q>```, ```<enter>```

The ```vim``` command allowed us to acess the code right away, in which we can edit using more vim techniques. I used the ```<down>``` key multiple times to get from the first line of code the line with the error in it. I then used the ```<x>``` at the location of second appreance of ```index1```, precisely at the ```1```. This helped me get rid of the ```1```. The used ```i``` to initiate vim's insert feature. This allowes me to put ```2``` and make sure the correct field name is ```index2```. After this edit was made, the ```esc``` key was used to exit the text of the code and the ```:wp``` command along with ```<enter>``` allows us to save and exit the file.

Keys pressed: ```<up>```and ```<enter>```

I used the ```<up>``` to use the same ```test.sh``` line and saved a lot of time. Then I used ```<enter>``` to excecute bash command to examine the ```test.sh``` file and show that all test cases have passed after the quick edit in the ```ListExamples.java``` file.


## Step9

Keys pressed: ```git commit -am "fixed index1 to index2"``` and ```<enter>```

I used the git commit command with a message to indicate what changes I have made for the commit I made. Then I used ```<enter>``` key to finalize and verify the change made to the code file. As shown, the following text in screenshot illustrates how many changes were made and who the commiter is.

Keys pressed: ```git push```, ```<enter>```

I used the ```git push``` command and the ```<enter>``` key to transfer the change back to the forked repository and the follwing text shows that it has sucessfully done its job!
